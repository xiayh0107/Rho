# Rho

Rho is an agent-native scientific workbench for R. Phase 0 validates a no-Python architecture with:

- Ark as the authoritative Workspace R kernel;
- a Rust broker using the Jupyter wire protocol directly;
- a separate Agent R process powered by `YuLab-SMU/aisdk`;
- typed workspace identities, a broker-owned SQLite event store, and structured output.

Agent R builds on the existing `YuLab-SMU/aisdk` package family. Rho reuses
`ChatSession`, streaming events, run traces, hooks, run states and branching;
`aisdk.console` is the reference frontend and developer fallback, not an
embedded terminal UI. See `docs/architecture/aisdk-family-integration.md`.
Proposed reusable changes to the family packages are listed in
`docs/architecture/aisdk-family-change-proposals.md`.

## Phase 0 commands

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/bootstrap-ark-windows.ps1
cargo test --workspace
cargo run -p rho-server -- doctor
cargo run -p rho-server -- probe-agent-r
cargo run -p rho-server -- probe-ark --kernelspec .rho/runtime/ark-0.1.252/kernel.json --code "1 + 1"
cargo run -p rho-server -- probe-coordinator --kernelspec .rho/runtime/ark-0.1.252/kernel.json
cargo run -p rho-server -- probe-completeness --kernelspec .rho/runtime/ark-0.1.252/kernel.json
cargo run -p rho-server -- probe-comms --kernelspec .rho/runtime/ark-0.1.252/kernel.json
cargo run -p rho-server -- probe-rich-output --kernelspec .rho/runtime/ark-0.1.252/kernel.json
```

An opt-in real-model coordinator probe can be run when the selected provider
credential is available to Agent R:

```powershell
cargo run -p rho-server -- probe-coordinator --kernelspec .rho/runtime/ark-0.1.252/kernel.json --store .rho/state/coordinator-probe-deepseek.sqlite --model deepseek:deepseek-v4-flash
```

This path has been verified end to end: DeepSeek requested one approved
`run_r` call, Ark created a live Workspace R object with value 42, and a
subsequent broker-backed inspection succeeded. Model credentials are not sent
to Workspace R, and broker-reported Agent diagnostics are secret-redacted.

The Windows bootstrap downloads the pinned Ark binary, verifies its SHA-256,
and writes a broker-private kernelspec with explicit `R_HOME`, `R_LIBS` and R
DLL search paths. It does not install Python or Jupyter.
On Windows, Rust can use either MSVC Build Tools or the GNU host toolchain with
the GCC linker already provided by Rtools.

The full reviewed implementation plan is in `Rho-implementation-plan.md`.
Current evidence and remaining Phase 0 gates are tracked in
`docs/phase-0-status.md`.
Release changes are recorded in `NEWS.md`; the active post-prototype roadmap
is in `docs/development-roadmap.md`.
The implementation handoff for the remaining `0.2.x` work is in
`docs/0.2x-agent-handoff.md`.
The verified Windows toolchain, packaging procedure and acceptance checklist
are documented in `docs/windows-build-environment.md`.

## Windows prototype

The first installable Tauri prototype is available at:

```text
target\release\bundle\nsis\Rho_0.2.0-dev.1_x64-setup.exe
```

It provides a live R editor and Console, Environment, real plot output,
Problems, and an Ask/Plan/Act Agent panel backed by DeepSeek and the same Ark
Workspace R. Ark and its Windows WebView loader are included in the installer;
the machine must already provide R, and aisdk is required only for Agent turns.
The Files, Agent/Environment and Console/Plots/Problems regions have draggable
dividers. Panel sizes persist locally, and the execution panel can be expanded
or restored from its toolbar.

Build it with:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/build-windows-installer.ps1
```

Installation prerequisites, verified behavior and intentionally deferred
features are documented in `docs/windows-prototype.md`.
