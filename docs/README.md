# Rho Documentation

The documentation is organized by purpose so that design intent, implementation
guidance, project tracking, and release evidence do not become mixed together.

## Status Prefixes

Every substantive document starts with a lifecycle prefix. `README.md` index
files are the only exception.

| Prefix | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `implemented-` | The documented design, plan, or behavior is implemented in the current product baseline |
| `active-` | The document is actively maintained or its work and acceptance gates are still underway |
| `accepted-` | The architecture decision has been adopted and remains authoritative |
| `proposed-` | The proposal is not yet approved or implemented |
| `historical-` | The document is a completed snapshot retained for traceability rather than current execution |

The prefix describes lifecycle state, while the directory describes document
type. For example, an implemented design remains under `design/` as
`implemented-...`; moving it to another directory is unnecessary. Update both
the filename prefix and the document's `Status:` field when its lifecycle
changes.

Add new documents to the category that describes their purpose. Prefer a dated
filename for time-bounded plans and keep durable decisions in ADRs.
