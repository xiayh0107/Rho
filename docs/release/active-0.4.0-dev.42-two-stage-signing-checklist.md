# Rho 0.4.0-dev.42 Two-Stage Free Trial Candidate Checklist

Date: 2026-08-17

Status: active source contract; `SP-FT2-DEV42` is authorized, external binary
artifact configuration and encrypted repository secret exist, and the initial
source integrated. Deterministic pre-sign bundle-type repair implementation and
local validation pass; protected integration is pending. Failed pre-Draft run
`31999076405` is
non-composable; no dev.42 tag, Draft, acceptance record, Release, or Pages entry
exists.

Owner: Rho release owner

Specification:
`../plans/active-2026-08-17-signpath-free-trial-two-stage-dev42-spec.md`

Change class / risk: D4 / R4

## Exact Identity

| Field | Required value | Current state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Version | `0.4.0-dev.42` | synchronized in source, Tauri/frontend metadata, lockfile, NEWS, and release notes |
| Tag/name | `v0.4.0-dev.42` / `Rho 0.4.0-dev.42` | unused; no Release |
| Channel | development prerelease | stable excluded |
| Source commit | one exact current protected-main commit | unresolved |
| Windows binary config | `github-actions-rho-desktop-binary` | created/visually verified in SignPath; encrypted repository secret registered |
| Windows installer config | protected existing NSIS config | existing Free Trial lane |
| Signing policy/certificate | existing `test-signing` / `Rho Test Signing` | self-signed, not publicly trusted |

## Source And Candidate Gates

- [x] active spec/cross-review/version/NEWS/release notes agree;
- [ ] `Full`, `NoBundle`, and `BundleOnly` build modes are deterministic and
  negative-tested; source contract negatives pass, hosted Windows execution is
  pending;
- [x] candidate-only binary request precedes NSIS bundle and installer request;
- [x] the exact single Tauri bundle-type token is changed from unknown to NSIS
  before binary signing, with missing/duplicate/size/count-shape negatives;
- [ ] signed executable hash/certificate survives bundling unchanged;
- [x] final installer is signed before its Tauri updater signature;
- [x] dev.42 platform evidence uses only the two-stage schema/check set;
- [ ] silent install proves installed executable bytes/signature and cleanup;
- [ ] secrets are bounded/masked and absent from logs/artifacts/source; source
  scoping passes, hosted log/artifact audit is pending;
- [ ] complete local affected matrix and four-leg protected CI pass;
- [ ] independent post-verification review has no blocking finding;
- [ ] exact main candidate run creates one immutable Draft;
- [ ] independent candidate audit verifies both SignPath request bindings,
  signed/installed bytes, macOS trust, and all native signatures.
- [ ] a separate protected transport-publication/finalization contract is
  integrated after Draft audit; it never rebuilds assets and normal Update Site
  stays fail-closed until exact acceptance;

## Installed And Update Gates

- [ ] Windows clean install resolves outside-workspace `rho-desktop.exe`;
- [ ] installed binary is not `NotSigned`, carries expected thumbprint,
  self-signed subject/issuer, and expected Free Trial status;
- [ ] Windows startup/core smoke, warning/publisher observation, and uninstall
  pass against exact hashes;
- [ ] macOS Developer ID, notarization, staple, Gatekeeper, startup, and
  uninstall/move-to-Trash observation pass;
- [ ] bounded dev.41→dev.42 native update succeeds on Windows x64 and macOS
  arm64 with explicit Install and Restart;
- [ ] final installed versions are dev.42 and Windows installed binary remains
  signed after updater installation;
- [ ] temporary fixture cleanup proves native development/stable endpoint
  `404` before publication.
- [ ] the exact audited prerelease is public only for bounded transport, has no
  acceptance asset yet, and normal Update Site/permanent endpoints remain
  untouched until both platform rows pass;

## Publication Gate

- [ ] exact machine-readable acceptance asset is generated from downloaded
  candidate evidence, reviewed, and uploaded once;
- [ ] owner records explicit GO/CONDITIONAL_GO consistent with Free Trial
  self-signed disclosure;
- [ ] protected transport publication changes only Draft/prerelease state, and
  protected finalization later adds only the exact acceptance asset before
  normal Update Site admission;
- [ ] normal Update Site exposes dev.42, exact hashes, and explicit untrusted
  Free Trial Windows notice;
- [ ] permanent `/updates/tauri/development.json` contains only final dev.42
  URLs/signatures and verifies over HTTPS;
- [ ] `/updates/tauri/stable.json` remains `404`;
- [ ] fresh installed manual update against the permanent endpoint passes.

Current release decision: `NO_RELEASE_DECISION`. Source implementation,
candidate construction, installed acceptance, publication, and permanent
native endpoint remain distinct facts.

## Rejected Pre-Draft Run

Run `31999076405` is rejected and non-composable. It passed the exact macOS
lane and, on Windows, `NoBundle`, binary request, binary promotion,
`BundleOnly`, signed-source hash survival, installer request/promotion, and the
final Tauri signature. Silent installation then proved the installed EXE hash
did not equal the signed pre-bundle EXE hash. Tauri `2.11.4` source review
showed its NSIS bundler patches the bundle-type token only while packaging and
restores the disk source afterward. No Windows platform evidence, aggregate
evidence, tag, Draft, or Release was created. A new protected-main run may use
the still-unused dev.42 identity only after the deterministic pre-sign NSIS
token patch and its regression tests integrate; it may reuse no run artifact,
request, hash, or notarization result.

Repair run `32002355917` is also non-composable. It stopped at the pre-sign
patch because a Windows-optimized binary retained an unrelated NSIS enum
literal alongside the unique unknown placeholder. It made no SignPath request
and created no Windows evidence, tag, Draft, or Release. The corrected patch
admits such pre-existing literals only when there is exactly one unknown token
and the NSIS count increases by exactly one.
