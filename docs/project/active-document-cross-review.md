# Rho Active And Proposed Document Cross-Review

Status: active documentation coordination record

Review date: 2026-08-18 (Phase 1 internal extension runtime accepted)
Scope: unfinished or acceptance-active specifications, plans, and release gates

Manual acceptance ownership: the runnable example workflow and candidate-level
evidence template are `test/acceptance-project/MANUAL-ACCEPTANCE.md` and
`test/acceptance-project/acceptance-results/CANDIDATE-RESULT-TEMPLATE.md`.
These records are queued and currently NOT RUN; they do not replace exact
release-candidate or package-specific acceptance gates.

## Purpose

This record prevents unfinished documents from being implemented as competing
sources of truth. It records lifecycle status, authority, dependencies, and the
conditions that permit future work. It does not replace the underlying design
or acceptance documents.

## Authority Order

When documents overlap, use this order:

1. accepted ADRs define durable architecture decisions;
2. the active development roadmap defines milestone order and product gates;
3. an active milestone or release contract defines implementation scope,
   schemas, sequencing, and acceptance for that milestone or candidate;
4. an active feature specification governs only its named feature and cannot
   redefine a milestone or release GO decision;
5. proposed direction, posture, and visual plans require explicit authorization
   and cannot amend an active contract implicitly.

At the same level, stop and amend the relevant documents before implementation
when two contracts define different state, persistence, approval, or acceptance
semantics.

## Status And Ownership Matrix

| Document | Status after review | Owns | May proceed when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `project/active-development-governance.md` | active | required proposal-to-release development lifecycle, risk/test depth, review, versioning, and evidence rules | applies continuously to all non-trivial work |
| `plans/active-2026-08-10-agpl-license-transition-spec.md` | active; LIC-1 and LIC-2 implementation, affected validation, UI/bundle review, exact-head hosted validation, and protected integration complete; exact candidate and installed distribution acceptance remain open | prospective `AGPL-3.0-only` source-license boundary, synchronized repository metadata, contribution terms, third-party exclusions, fixed installed resource copies, About legal notice, and transition gates | preserve the integrated license/resource boundary; SignPath readiness may reference but not redefine it; exact candidate and installed acceptance remain release-owned |

## Implemented Status Corrections

- `implementation/implemented-wp2-data-viewer-interface.md` is implemented in
  `8982b12`; its focused evidence is in `verification/wp2/`.
- `implementation/implemented-wp4-project-skills-interface.md` is implemented
  in `2415c3f` and hardened in `3d45af2`; its focused evidence is in
  `verification/wp4/`.
- These corrections do not close the `0.3.x` milestone. Package implementation,
  focused verification, milestone acceptance, and public release are separate
  states.

## Resolved Cross-Document Conflicts

### AGPL license transition ownership

The active AGPL transition contract owns only the prospective license and
repository metadata for Rho-original source. Issue #26 retains all SignPath,
Authenticode, privacy, code-signing-policy, credential, approval, signed-byte,
and public-release authority. An OSI-approved AGPL license satisfies a license
category prerequisite but does not establish SignPath Foundation acceptance.

Historical releases and candidates retain the grant and exact bytes that
applied when they were distributed. In particular, the existing
`v0.4.0-dev.27` candidate cannot be relabelled or used as AGPL evidence; a
future distributable AGPL candidate requires its own license/notice packaging,
interactive legal-notice review, exact-candidate validation, and release gate.

Rho-original content may adopt `AGPL-3.0-only`, while Jet, Ark, frontend vendor
assets, dependency-manager content, and other third-party works remain under
their own licenses. The transition does not reinterpret or relicense those
components. Cargo, frontend, and R package metadata project the same Rho
decision using each ecosystem's recognized identifier.

The source implementation could not merge until required historical
contributors granted the additional AGPL permission or an authorized
legal/ownership determination established sufficient inbound permission.
`Emberwhirl` and `xuzhougeng` have each now supplied the explicit additional
grant in PR #30, so the contributor gate is closed. LIC-1 exact synchronized-
tree validation and protected integration are complete. LIC-2 now owns only
the fixed installed Rho-license resource and About legal notice needed before a
future candidate. Installed legal-notice and distribution acceptance remain
release gates.

The accepted About/update design remains the application-information and
interaction owner. LIC-2 extends its static product information with the
license identity, corresponding-source statement, existing source link, and a
fixed bundled-license reveal action; it does not change diagnostics, update
channels, endpoints, or installer execution. The human-facing information
contract still excludes raw resource paths and internal command details.
Tauri bundle metadata owns packaging projection only.

SP-READY1 owns one later Issue #26 privacy amendment: update discovery becomes
manual-only, so startup performs no automatic request and no longer persists
background-check throttling/dismissal state. The accepted design retains the
manual UI, endpoint, channel, allowlist, bounds, timeout, failure, and Pages
contracts. Provider, Agent, DOI, environment, R execution, and external-tool
documents retain their existing explicit user-action or approval boundaries;
the public privacy summary creates no new network authority. Issue #26 retains
SignPath, Authenticode, credential, signed-byte, and publication authority, and
the `dev.33` checklist alone may admit an exact artifact.

The 2026-08-12 application-form audit found bounded public-guidance gaps
inside SP-READY1 rather than a new product or release authority: the required
SignPath attribution named its parties without linking them, and users could
see uninstall-retention behavior but not executable Windows/macOS uninstall
steps. The application also requires the Download URL itself to mention
SignPath Foundation, so a policy link alone is insufficient. PR #46 owns the
linked attribution, explicit pending-application disclosure, README/download-
page instructions, and deterministic positive/negative enforcement. It changes
no installer, credential, updater, signing, candidate, schema, or application-
version behavior. Exact head `0e618c8` passed run `31563972114`, received
independent latest-push CODEOWNER approval, and merged as `71dfd3a`; exact-main
run `31576354218` passed all four source legs. Update-site run `31646300758`
then published `gh-pages@76d463a` from exact current main `b6bc441` without
changing the published `dev.24` identity or artifact hashes. Independent live
review confirmed the pending-application disclosure, both official attribution
links, both uninstall instructions, retention warning, policy links, and
unsigned-Windows statement. PR #46 integration/deployment is accepted. The
owner MFA audit, Foundation decision, approved-project GitHub App/trusted-build
configuration, real identifiers, production signing, candidate, and release
gates remain external or later-owned facts.

The subsequent external audit found a real SignPath Free Trial organization,
valid `rho` project, self-signed test certificate, valid `test-signing` policy,
valid installer artifact configuration, submitter API token, and protected
repository secret. That corrects the stale claim that no SignPath project or
identifiers existed, but it does not establish Foundation acceptance, public
Windows trust, or production-signing readiness. The owner explicitly
authorized FT-SIGN1 to validate only this existing test transport. Its owning
contract isolates one exact unsigned Issue #33 artifact from candidate and
manual-publish workflows, writes no Release/update state, and stops after one
accepted hosted request. The initial variable interface is superseded because
GitHub renders a step environment before an in-step mask can execute; one
exact-schema protected JSON secret now owns all deployment values and must be
expanded only after strict validation. This resolves the conflict in PR #51,
whose older design coupled the
test certificate directly to publication lanes and therefore must not merge.

Protected integration of FT-SIGN1 and its logging correction preserved those
boundaries, but the hosted GitHub connector returned HTTP 400 authorization
failure after validating the real GitHub artifact. A dedicated regular CI user
with only the existing test policy's Submitter role and a valid REST token did
not change that hosted result. The same policy's SignPath-managed CI Integration
surface explicitly documents the official `Submit-SigningRequest` PowerShell
module. FT-SIGN1 may therefore replace only its connector transport with an
exact-version, module-file-hash-verified, local-ZIP REST upload. It may not add
origin claims, a trusted-build link, production policy/certificate use,
candidate/manual-publish changes, or reuse the returned test bytes publicly.
Run `31674347116` proved that direct transport and signature verification work,
but its pre-script environment log exposed the organization identifier. It is
failure evidence, not accepted smoke evidence. The bounded recovery may migrate
the five deployment values into one protected JSON secret, reject malformed or
extra configuration before module install, remove the obsolete variables after
a clean retry, and rerun once without expanding signing or publication scope.
That recovery completed in protected-config merge `6714e73`. Replacement run
`31675464182` passed, its request is visible as `Completed`, downloaded evidence
reproduced signer/hash/no-publication facts, and a full log scan found no unique
deployment value. The obsolete variables and leaked predecessor run were then
deleted. FT-SIGN1 is complete; its self-signed bytes cannot satisfy candidate,
public trust, production signing, MAC5, publication, or updater gates.

DEV38-SIGN1 is the separately authorized D4/R4 bridge from that completed
transport proof to one fresh prerelease candidate. It cannot compose or relabel
the FT-SIGN1 `dev.37` request or artifact. Candidate mode alone may submit the
new final NSIS installer after complete build/smoke checks, then embed bounded
request/module/thumbprint/self-signed/pre-sign/post-sign facts in the existing
Windows platform evidence before aggregation. Fork rehearsal remains unsigned
and cannot enter Draft/publication admission. A valid Free Trial record is
required for every newly constructed candidate, while compatibility remains
limited to the exact accepted `dev.27` Draft and published `dev.24` evidence.

This package does not satisfy SignPath Foundation acceptance, production
publisher trust, GitHub App/trusted-build, organization-owner MFA, or the
planned two-stage production executable/installer process. Public release notes,
the code-signing policy, and evidence-derived download-page wording must all say
that `dev.38` uses a Free Trial self-signed test certificate, is not publicly
trusted, and may still trigger Windows/SmartScreen warnings. About/Update V1
retains manifest/Pages authority; RELEASE-NOTES-1 retains exact body ownership;
the `dev.38` checklist alone may bind final artifacts, human installed
acceptance, MAC5, and publication. Automation cannot replace that human gate.

On 2026-08-13 the project owner explicitly authorized a different public
decision: one evaluation-only conditional prerelease may disclose Windows
human installation and enabled-Gatekeeper human launch as not run. CPREL1 owns
that new decision and advances to fresh `dev.39`; it does not retroactively
weaken or rewrite DEV38-SIGN1. Ordinary schema-v1 `GO`, candidate construction,
signing/notarization, hashes, log privacy, protected publication, and exact-body
controls remain intact. Schema-v2 `CONDITIONAL_GO` is actor-bound,
public-prerelease-only, allowlisted to `dev.39`, and requires the canonical two
limitations. About/Update V1 keeps manifest and Pages authority, while CPREL1
adds acceptance validation and conditional disclosure to that projection.

### Navigation and layout state

The Human/Agent posture and task-oriented Task/Runs/Review navigation are now
implemented through the focused UX4 contracts. The adaptive-work-surface
contract owns the simple Agent-first Task default and contextual file, run,
Artifact, and audit surfaces. The modernization plan may style these states and
the Human-first Code/Analyze/Agent selector but cannot replace them, create a
competing top-level state, or change persistence semantics. The focused
2026-08-04 M1 contract authorizes presentation-only foundation and shell
hierarchy work. The separate M2 contract owns Human-first editor hierarchy,
existing tab/panel geometry presentation, and correction of the existing
`human_preset` restoration path without adding persistence or top-level state.
Scientific/Agent workflow-surface redesign and themes remain unauthorized.

The focused M3 contract may restyle and reorganize projections of existing
Runs, Problems, Plots, Environment, Agent events, approvals, and file-edit
proposals. It cannot redefine their status values, persistence, revisions,
mutation consequences, approval ownership, or recovery actions. Direct UI
environment requests and Agent approvals remain visibly and operationally
separate. Phase 4 remains unauthorized.

The intuitive-interaction proposal may improve task-level wording, empty
states, Run scope, result handoff, and recovery without defining another
top-level navigation. Posture continues to own Human-first/Agent-first and
Direct/Monitor/Review. Modernization continues to own visual presentation.

### Agent intent and permission presentation

The intuitive-interaction proposal owns one default natural-language entry and
consequence-based escalation. It does not remove broker Ask/Plan/Act policy or
make natural-language intent an authorization. The posture proposal owns any
expert-visible placement of those policy modes and top-level Agent navigation.

The accepted decision uses one default `Ask Rho` entry, starts in the least-
authority policy lane capable of understanding the request, and retains
Ask/Plan/Act in an advanced Agent control. Posture changes do not change
permission, and protected actions retain their typed approval, file-edit, or
environment-operation lane.

### Scientific operations and approval lanes

The active `0.3.x` contract owns direct environment-operation requests and
their dedicated dialog. Agent approvals, file-edit acceptance, and environment
operations remain separate broker records and decision surfaces. Posture and
modernization work may project or restyle them but cannot merge them.

### Model settings progressive disclosure

The active system-credential specification is the single owner of Model
settings credential presentation, the CRED-UX2 original Issue #4 workflow, and
the CRED-UX3 discovery-first model picker. Its implemented CRED-UX4A package
owns the Connection/Model/Capability foundation and existing-turn routing.
Its active CRED-UX4A-R1 package owns the installed settings-entry recovery,
Provider-first ordering, reviewed `aisdk.providers` adapter allowlist, optional
literal Base URL overrides, model capability cards, and Connections/routing
navigation. It does not own a new credential source, network lane, schema, or
capability consumer. Owner and replacement installed-candidate acceptance
remain open. The future worker boundary remains proposed; CRED-UX4B/C are not
active.
CRED-UX2 supersedes only CRED-UX1's single global Advanced layout. It replaces
that layout with provider cards, one selected-provider Advanced disclosure, a
dedicated Add provider Connection -> Model workflow, a dedicated Model editor,
separated Danger zones, and deterministic operation feedback.

The implemented Agent LLM V1 design remains authoritative for stable provider
and model IDs, global settings, model enablement, selected-model semantics,
capability gating, attribution, connection-test bounds, and no silent fallback.
The human-facing information specification remains authoritative for friendly
status/error projection and credential redaction. MAC3 remains authoritative
only for the Apple Keychain adapter and macOS-native acceptance. CRED-UX2 adds
no provider-enable persistence, command, schema, credential source, network
authority, project scope, or release authority. CRED-UX3 alone authorizes one
bounded read-only model-list request after an explicit setup action. It reuses
the existing stable Provider identity and system credential, prohibits
redirects and environment-derived endpoint expansion, and leaves the LLM V1
model record, capability, enablement, selection, attribution, and no-fallback
contracts unchanged. Provider results remain transient suggestions; the manual
Model ID path is the recovery authority when discovery is empty, unsupported,
or fails.

CRED-UX4 resolves a newly demonstrated mismatch with the exact `aisdk` commit
pinned by `rho.agent`: `aisdk` supports one default ChatSession model plus
arbitrary named session capability routes with language/embedding/image types
and required capability attributes. The former one-model Rho transport was the
gap; CRED-UX4A now resolves it for existing Ask/Plan/Act turns without enabling
the separately gated optional-route consumers.
The redesign does not transfer model semantics into the frontend and does not
authorize prompt-classified routing. Rho owns stable persisted references,
revision checks, credential isolation, typed consumer admission, and user-facing
projection; `aisdk` retains model construction and capability-route resolution.
CRED-UX4A-R1 adds `aisdk.providers` only through a pinned dependency and an
explicit Rho-owned constructor/preset allowlist. The package's load-time
registry does not authorize settings to name an arbitrary R package or
function. Provider model responses remain availability suggestions, while an
exact `aisdk` catalog match remains the only automatic default-capability
evidence used for model cards and route compatibility.

The proposed worker boundary deliberately avoids injecting all optional-route
keys into the main Agent R. Existing Agent turns receive only the effective
`agent.chat` or `agent.act` credential. Future typed capability consumers must
be activated separately and use one broker-resolved route and one credential
in one isolated worker. Workspace R, project files, Artifact admission,
approval lanes, and Agent history remain owned by their existing contracts.

The Issue #4 provider reference shows an active/inactive control, but the
existing data model has no provider-enable state. CRED-UX2 therefore derives a
provider readiness badge from credential state and enabled models rather than
inventing a second enablement authority. Model enablement remains editable only
inside the dedicated Model editor, while deletion remains in a separate closed
Danger zone. This resolves the visual reference without conflicting with the
implemented configuration schema.

Safari/WebKit review resolved the child-dialog isolation detail without
changing ownership: Model settings, Add provider, and Model editor use sibling
modal roots. Opening a child removes the main root from rendering and the
accessibility tree, then exposes the child as the sole active dialog; inactive
siblings have no active role. WKWebView otherwise projects nested modal content
as an empty accessible container. This is the cross-platform implementation of
the existing containment rule, not a new persistence, credential, command, or
product-dialog authority.

### Artifacts and review

Implemented WP3 artifact records and provenance are the V1 authority. The
RStudio-inspired proposal may sequence richer artifact capabilities. The
posture proposal may define how artifacts are navigated and reviewed, but any
version, link, annotation, finding, or acceptance schema must be an additive,
migration-safe extension of WP3 after a focused design.

### Scholarly evidence workspace and claim review

The evidence-workspace proposal owns project-scoped scholarly evidence entries,
citation normalization, bounded evidence excerpts, and claim-to-evidence
linkage. It does not replace WP3 Artifact provenance, RA-RC internal evidence,
package help, or a full manuscript/publication system.

The accepted separation is:

- WP3 Artifact provenance answers what source, run, and environment produced a
  project result;
- RA-RC answers whether internal project evidence is reproducible and how runs
  differ;
- the evidence workspace answers which external scholarly evidence a project
  claim cites and whether that linkage is structurally reviewable.

An external citation does not satisfy internal reproducibility evidence, and a
clean internal audit does not prove that a manuscript claim is literature-
grounded. Claim-review statuses therefore remain bounded to `linked`,
`missing_evidence`, `unresolved_source`, `incomplete_evidence`, and
`cross_project_rejected`; they are not semantic truth verdicts.

The RStudio-inspired proposal continues to own broader post-`0.3.x`
capability sequencing. The evidence-workspace proposal narrows only the
scholarly evidence/claim slice and explicitly restricts core implementation to
small-footprint permissive-license components and open-data providers. Hosted
platforms and heavier literature services remain optional later connectors and
may not become the sole core dependency.

### Reproducibility audit and run comparison

The reproducibility proposal is a read-only derived evidence layer over
existing run, environment snapshot, Problem, and WP3 Artifact records. It does
not create a second audit database, durable review-finding lifecycle, Artifact
acceptance state, task model, job system, or repair channel. Its deterministic
facts remain independent of optional Agent explanation.

RA-RC1 is the first recommended post-`0.3.x` evidence workstream, but it is
blocked until baseline-hardening BH1-BH3 provide canonical authoritative
project identity, fail-closed historical commands, and accepted migration
evidence. Project
identity must not be inferred from source paths, current UI state, timestamps,
or Artifact filenames. RA-RC2 static project audit follows only after RA-RC1
acceptance and retains explicit parser, scan, and evidence limitations.

AUDIT-REL1 is a bounded repair to the implemented RA-RC2 path. It may harden
Unicode parsing and request recovery and may block a disk-backed check when an
open supported source document is dirty. It cannot change rule identity,
severity, persistence, project scope, or create automatic save/repair behavior.
AUDIT-UX1 remains the owner of shared Human/Agent result language.

### Implemented baseline hardening

The baseline-hardening plan owns repair of project identity, project-scoped
queries and model context, retry/continuation admission, project-switch
concurrency, schema migration, and retention semantics. It does not own a new
scientific capability or UI information architecture.

BH1-BH3 are prerequisites for any proposed feature that reads, compares,
continues, or executes historical project records. Existing WP1-WP4 contracts
remain authoritative for their feature behavior; affected evidence must be
rerun after hardening. Legacy records without authoritative ownership remain
explicitly unscoped and cannot be assigned from paths, timestamps, current UI
state, or filenames. Interface and posture proposals may present hardening
states but cannot redefine their persistence or concurrency rules.

The intuitive-interaction proposal projects BH2 switch blockers and BH4
retention semantics into user language. It cannot offer `Stop and switch`,
Undo, hide, prune, or delete behavior until the corresponding backend contract
exists and is tested.

For BH2 V1, any waiting approval capable of later continuation or mutation
blocks switching to another project. The user must accept, decline, or cancel
it first. Switching Human/Agent posture or Direct/Monitor/Review within the
same project remains allowed and preserves the pending decision.

### Background jobs

The RStudio-inspired workflow proposal owns the future broker job capability
contract. A posture implementation may display those jobs in Monitor or Review
but cannot define a second runtime, policy, or persistence model.

Quarto is the first scheduled broker-owned local-job adapter in Wave 13. The
RStudio-inspired proposal owns its typed render/job behavior; implemented WP3
continues to own V1 Artifact records and provenance. Quarto exit status defines
process success, while parsed diagnostics are bounded projections into the
existing Problems model. The adapter must not authorize a generic shell or
arbitrary process command.

`targets` follows the accepted Quarto/local-job contract in Wave 14. The
`targets` package owns `_targets` metadata and pipeline semantics; Rho owns
project/environment admission, durable job state, cancellation/restart
reconciliation and Artifact links. A pipeline process is not Workspace R or
Agent R, and importing a result into Workspace R is a separate recorded action.

### Editor Intelligence And Problems

Monaco remains the frontend editor. Air and R `languageserver` are alternative
providers behind one Rho-owned bounded language-service contract, not parallel
authorities. Wave 8 selects one primary provider; Wave 9 integrates it before
adding `lintr`. Provider results are bound to canonical project identity and
document versions and cannot redefine BH1-BH3 project ownership or switching.

The existing Problems model remains authoritative. Language-service, `lintr`,
Quarto and later job diagnostics identify their producer and are normalized,
bounded and deduplicated; no provider receives its own durable Problems store.
Formatting, quick fixes and refactors continue through reviewed file edits and
cannot bypass Agent proposal/Accept or direct user save semantics.

### Viewer Component Boundary

TanStack Table may own frontend virtualization, focus, selection and column
presentation in Wave 10. Implemented WP2 remains authoritative for supported
object classes, server-side pages, sorting/filtering semantics, byte and
dimension limits, state revisions and stale-object rejection. Implemented WP3
continues to own export and provenance; frontend table state cannot claim a
full-object export or current scientific truth.

DATA-VIEWER-ROW-SHAPE-R1 repairs an implementation deviation from WP2's fixed
JSON contract: row `cells` and additive `cell_states` are ordered arrays, not
objects keyed by display labels. The repair may strip R list names, enforce the
shape through Ark/Tauri smoke, and distinguish protocol/render failure from
actual stale revision/token rejection. WS3-Q1 retains query/sort/reinspection
semantics, WS3-Q2 retains type and missing-value meaning, and Issue #33 retains
focus/selection/refresh presentation. No owner, schema, mutation, polling,
project, approval, export, or release authority moves.

### Git Ownership And Mutation

The RStudio-inspired proposal owns the future typed Git capability and prefers
`gitoxide` as an implementation candidate. BH1 owns canonical project identity;
Git must independently validate repository identity and current diff/revision.
Git history does not replace Rho runs, approvals or Artifact provenance.

Wave 11 is read-only. Wave 12 mutations require an exact selected file or hunk,
preserve unrelated dirty work, and use a Git-specific policy/recovery contract.
The public Workbench Protocol cannot expose Git mutation before the internal
contract is accepted. Credentials, remotes and network mutation remain outside
Waves 11-12.

### Public Workbench Protocol, CLI, and MCP

The public-protocol proposal owns the externally consumable semantic projection,
its independent version/schema/error contract, authenticated local CLI/MCP
transports, project-scoped event replay, and the later external-execution
admission contract. It does not replace the current internal framed protocol,
desktop frontend, coordinator, store, approval lanes, or Workspace R authority.

WB1-WB2 remain read-only and wait for `0.3.x` plus baseline-hardening BH1-BH3.
No public adapter may fill missing record ownership from the active workspace,
source path, timestamp, or filename. WB3 additionally requires a separate
security/approval checkpoint; external host confirmation is evidence, not Rho
authorization by default. A new Web control plane, thin-desktop migration,
remote gateway, and non-loopback deployment remain outside WB1-WB3.

### Implementation sequences

The `0.3.x` work-package sequence remains the historical authority for the
current scientific milestone. Other documents' Phase A-D or Phase 1-4 labels
are local to those documents and do not unlock, supersede, or run inside a
`0.3.x` package without an explicit contract amendment.

The cross-proposal schedule is the Wave 0-14 Implementation Program in
[`active-development-roadmap.md`](active-development-roadmap.md). This record
defines the coordination constraints that apply to that schedule:

The current program state is **Waves 1-14 implementation code committed (2026-08-01)**.
BH1-BH5 are accepted with verification evidence. RA-RC1, WB1, WB2, UX4, RA-RC2,
WS2 (Air selected), WS3 (basic table), WS4 (git CLI), WS6 (async Quarto job),
WS6A (targets read-only inspection), and WS9 (lintr) are committed. Per-wave
verification and manual acceptance evidence are pending for Waves 4-14; each
exit gate must be independently closed. The next-phase task plan
(`proposed-2026-08-01-next-phase-task-plan.md`) decomposes the remaining work
into sequenced work packages.

| Wave | Coordination result |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | `0.3.x`, exact `0.2.0-dev.12` release acceptance, and About/update acceptance may proceed independently; no track's evidence closes another track |
| 1 | BH1 is the primary implementation; UX1 and modernization Phase 1 may run only as contract, inventory, fixture, usability-baseline, token, icon, dimension, and behavior-neutral component work |
| 2 | BH3 retains a migration gate even when developed with BH1 schema work; BH2 waits for BH1 and owns project-switch truth; UX cannot promise switching or recovery semantics early |
| 3 | RA-RC1 is the first new post-`0.3.x` capability and stops for review; it remains read-only and cannot create a second evidence store |
| 4 | UX2 owns the novice first-use-to-result workflow; modernization may style it but cannot introduce structural posture navigation |
| 5 | WB1 owns the public read-only semantic boundary; no CLI, MCP, or external execution contract may become authoritative first |
| 6 | WB2 owns authenticated local CLI/MCP/events and remains read-only; cross-platform transport validation consumes the accepted WB1/WB2 contract |
| 7 | RA-RC2 precedes a separately selected EW-CR1, UX3, UX4, or UX5 package; BH4 precedes retention/deletion, posture precedes UX4 Agent-entry placement, and EW-CR1 requires accepted `0.3.x`, BH1-BH3, and RA-RC1 evidence |
| 8 | Retain Monaco and compare Air with R `languageserver`; select one primary backend before product integration |
| 9 | Integrate the selected language backend, then normalize optional `lintr` findings into Problems; providers never write files directly |
| 10 | TanStack Table may enhance the UI only; implemented WP2/WP3 remain data, bounds, staleness, export and provenance authorities |
| 11 | `gitoxide` read-only status/diff/history only, bound to canonical project and repository identities |
| 12 | Selected Git mutations require their own stale/rejection/failure/recovery gate; no credentials or remotes |
| 13 | Freeze a narrow local-job contract through Quarto rendering; no arbitrary process execution or second Artifact store |
| 14 | Stop after read-only `targets` inspection, then separately authorize execution and pipeline-to-Quarto composition |

Only one new post-`0.3.x` product-capability stream may be implemented at a
time. Independent acceptance/release work and behavior-neutral design-system
foundation may run in parallel. Parallel work must not depend on an unaccepted
schema, public protocol, navigation state, approval lane, project-switch rule,
or retention behavior.

Moving between waves is not implicit authorization. For each bounded package,
record entry evidence, activate or create its focused implementation handoff,
update this matrix, and name the next mandatory stop point. Later packages in
the same proposal remain proposed.

### Rust toolchain compatibility boundaries

The Issue #28 MSRV contract owns only the Rust compiler floor, Cargo resolver,
locked workspace-test commands, and a read-only non-packaging compatibility
workflow. `rust-toolchain.toml` remains the interactive development selection;
`Cargo.lock` remains exact dependency identity; the Windows build environment
retains Rtools/GNU linkage; and the macOS arm64 contract retains native runner,
packaging, signing, notarization, and MAC5 authority.

The four compatibility legs cannot build or upload installers, mutate a GitHub
Release, satisfy candidate evidence, or close installed acceptance. Candidate
workflows consume only the additional `--locked` source invariant. Resolver 3
may prefer an older MSRV-compatible dependency during a future intentional
lock refresh, but Issue #28 adds no dependency update and permits no lockfile
churn. No active product, schema, approval, environment, credential, Agent, or
update contract overlaps this build-only authority.

### Release boundaries

`WINDOWS-INSTALLED-ISSUE33-A1` separates product-defect closure from public
release admission. An unsigned, exact-source, clean-profile Windows package may
prove Issue #33's six named interactions and close that Issue, but it cannot
satisfy Authenticode, exact signed-candidate, broad human installed acceptance,
MAC5, publication, or updater evidence. The `0.4.0-dev.37` checklist owns both
that narrow allowance and the continued release `NO-GO`; no feature document
may relabel the review artifact as a candidate.

Two pre-artifact Ark download attempts returned GitHub Release `503` responses.
The bounded recovery amendment remains inside the same acceptance authority:
four checksum-before-promotion attempts may recover a transient transport
failure, while exhaustion still fails closed. It adds no credential, mirror,
runtime-version, installer, signing, release, or publication authority, and a
run that stops before package construction does not consume its single-use
artifact identity. A later `dev.34` run did construct an installer and exposed
a quoted NSIS registry-path defect before all scenarios and cleanup. Its exact
failure is historical and non-composable. `dev.35` normalized one balanced
outer quote pair in both normal resolution and fail-closed cleanup, but its
environment-only WebView2 debug request was superseded by Wry's explicit
browser arguments. `dev.36` may use one repository-owned Tauri configuration
overlay only in the Issue #33 workflow, bound to loopback; ordinary candidate
builds pass no overlay. Neither correction may guess registry paths or add
installer, signing, release, publication, credential, or product authority.
Run `31638482434` then compiled the `dev.36` release executable twice, but the
official Tauri NSIS-tool transport disconnected and returned HTTP `503` before
installer construction. The same active checklist owns a three-attempt maximum
for recognized transient bundler transport failures only; compilation,
configuration, unknown, exhausted, or ordinary candidate failures remain
single-attempt and fail closed. No mirror, alternate tool identity, signing,
publication, credential, or release authority is added.
Run `31641866471` then built and installed `dev.36`, proved exact installed
identity/runtime, passed the five original scenarios, captured a screenshot,
and cleaned up. Its sixth harness predicate waited on
`projectRefreshSequence`, although real watcher refresh does not change that
counter, so the artifact is rejected and Issue #33 remains open. `dev.37`
instead observes reloaded content in a clean background document plus a higher
project revision before asserting the active Monaco model, viewport, and cursor
are unchanged. This evidence correction owns no product behavior, schema,
persistence, signing, publication, credential, or candidate authority.
Exact-main source run `31644418691` and installed run `31644429787` then passed
at `7ab861b01a36313150988b1e2fa8fdc2056325d9`. The installed record proves all
six scenarios, exact embedded identity/runtime, installer/executable/screenshot
hashes, and fail-closed uninstall cleanup; artifact `9160516935` is the bounded
evidence. Issue #33 closure is GO. This does not satisfy or authorize Windows
signing, candidate construction, human installed-candidate acceptance, MAC5,
publication, or updater mutation.

RELEASE-NOTES-1 owns only the reviewed GitHub Release body source and its
exact-commit stale guard. The exact-candidate checklist retains identity,
artifact/evidence, installed acceptance, and GO/NO-GO authority; About/update
V1 retains channel, schema, endpoint, summary projection, and Pages authority;
Apple and Windows signing lanes retain installer trust. `NEWS.md` remains the
installed-behavior ledger and cannot be replaced by curated release prose.

The existing accepted `v0.4.0-dev.27` Draft predates the notes-file contract.
Its release ID, tag, commit, and generic body form one explicit compatibility
tuple. The implementation may validate that tuple during a later publication
attempt but cannot add a historical file to its commit, rewrite its body,
replace assets, or infer that any other missing file is legacy. Newly
constructed candidates must carry `.github/release-notes/v<version>.md` in the
exact source commit. The first canonical body line remains a bounded plain-text
summary so the existing update-site projection does not gain a competing
summary owner. Tauri updater/signing and Issue #26 Authenticode work remain
separate.

`active-2026-08-15-tauri-native-updater-spec.md` is the required separate
contract for the native-updater work explicitly deferred by Issue #27 and the
About/Update V1 design. It is not an amendment of Issue #27's candidate-site
scope. The active package keeps V1 discovery as the manual-only channel/UI
owner and uses distinct `/updates/tauri/{stable,development}.json` resources,
so a Tauri-schema manifest cannot be misread as the existing schema-v1
discovery manifest. It consumes the first bounded reviewed Release-body line
from RELEASE-NOTES-1; it creates no second notes author.

The cross-review resolved four implementation constraints that remain active
acceptance gates:

1. Windows final-byte order must remain `build -> SignPath Authenticode ->
   final Tauri signature`; a pre-Authenticode updater signature is invalid.
2. macOS must notarize/staple the application archive used by the native
   updater, not merely the public DMG, before final Tauri signing. MAC4/MAC5
   retain Developer ID, entitlement, notarization, and release acceptance
   authority.
3. Linux's active AppImage plan continues to reject automatic/native Linux
   updates in this round. The shared plugin dependency must not create a Linux
   endpoint, key exposure, or install path.
4. The new private-key/password secrets may appear only in trusted candidate
   jobs; Pages, public publication, source CI, fork rehearsal, and browser/mock
   code receive neither. A fresh `dev.40` checklist must bind exact updater
   assets, signatures, installed-update evidence, and GO/NO-GO separately from
   `dev.39`'s historical conditional record.
5. The plugin may parse a Rust-owned check result, but may not own an
   unbounded download or destructive default install. Before shutdown, the
   runtime must allowlist the final GitHub Release URL/redirect hosts, bound
   bytes, and independently verify the configured public key. Windows exits
   only after spawning the verified NSIS handoff; macOS stages and
   code-signature-checks on the target volume, preserves the existing bundle,
   and restores it if replacement or launch fails. Browser/mock mode may
   demonstrate the state but must never claim installation.

The active release checklist is the sole GO/NO-GO authority for the exact
`0.2.0-dev.12` candidate. About/update V1 was implemented afterward and has its
own Pages and installed-app gates. It cannot be included in, block, or validate
that candidate retroactively; inclusion requires a revised candidate and new
affected evidence.

The macOS arm64 specification does not amend or reuse the exact
`0.2.0-dev.12` release contract. The rejected `0.4.0-dev.1` rehearsal and its
repaired `0.4.0-dev.2` rehearsal remain historical fork evidence. Upstream
independently advanced through `0.4.0-dev.15`; after non-rewriting integration,
the combined source first became `0.4.0-dev.16`. Its checklist and passing
review-only runs are now historical because Issue #4's user-visible changes
advanced the live candidate through `0.4.0-dev.17`, CRED-UX3 advanced it to
the rejected `0.4.0-dev.18`, and CRED-UX4A-R1 reached the now-historical
`0.4.0-dev.19`. Issue #6 first produced rejected identity `0.4.0-dev.20`; its
installed corrections produced `0.4.0-dev.21`, whose remaining Problems-only
navigation was rejected by owner workflow review. The Console error-site
correction produced `0.4.0-dev.22`, whose installed parse-error path still
required the user to select an already parser-located token. R5 produced
`0.4.0-dev.23`, whose source validation passed but whose artifact was not built
before Issue #9 advanced the combined identity to `0.4.0-dev.24`. MAC4
implemented parallel candidate construction, signed/notarized macOS packaging,
immutable draft assembly, and separately gated publication. The exact upstream
`dev.24` candidate then passed installed acceptance, MAC5, protected
publication, and live update-site verification without asset replacement.
Issue #5 advanced behavior source to `0.4.0-dev.25`; none of the immutable
`dev.24` artifact or acceptance evidence was reusable for that successor.
Candidate run `31336769848` then consumed and rejected `dev.25` after Windows
failed a CRLF-only contract assertion, despite its macOS artifact passing
signing/notarization/stapling. The bounded validation repair advances the fresh
candidate identity to `0.4.0-dev.26`; neither earlier identity is composable.
PR #12 integrated the repair as upstream
`a5fc4a153bb420968155984bf8e980973c775015`, and protected candidate run
`31337666426` passed the complete Windows and signed/notarized macOS lanes plus
immutable Draft assembly. Installed acceptance, MAC5, and publication remain
separate open facts.

MAC4-R is a bounded pre-merge evidence lane owned jointly by the active macOS
specification and exact-candidate checklist. It may use fork repository secrets
to build both platforms and upload short-lived Actions artifacts, but it cannot
create a tag or Release and its evidence cannot satisfy candidate, MAC5,
About/update, Pages, or publication gates. Candidate mode remains restricted to
`YuLab-SMU/Rho`; no other document owns or consumes rehearsal evidence.

Hosted MAC4-R failures may repair only an existing owning contract: WS1-L2
continues to own fail-closed local-source containment, MAC2 continues to own
Apple-Silicon R architecture policy, and the exact-candidate checklist continues
to own synchronized Cargo identity and the existing candidate workflow
contract. Windows path handling and CRLF/current-host test portability do not
transfer those authorities to MAC4-R. CRLF repair applies uniformly at the
release-contract test input boundary while leaving every workflow and metadata
assertion unchanged. Any repair must be regression-covered and accepted by a
new exact-commit two-platform rehearsal; cross-run artifact composition is
forbidden.

The exact-candidate checklist also owns the final-DMG notarization boundary.
Tauri may sign the app and DMG, but MAC4-R removes notarization API variables
from that bundle command so it can explicitly submit the final DMG once,
validate that submission's own bounded Accepted receipt, and only then staple,
assess, smoke, and emit platform evidence. This repair neither transfers
release ownership to Tauri nor permits an app-only receipt, a repository-wide
history inference, or evidence composed from another run. The macOS
specification owns the bounded arm64 diagnostic; shared runtime and R
architecture policy remain unchanged.

MAC4-R2 is the closed bounded installed-app repair lane jointly recorded by the
active macOS specification and current candidate checklist. It added only
`com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` to the macOS signing plist,
validated that exact final signature on Rho and Ark, advanced the fork
application identity, and passed replacement rehearsal evidence. It did not authorize
DYLD/JIT/unsigned-memory/debugger exceptions, bundling or modifying R itself,
MAC5, candidate/draft creation, tag, Release, Pages, or publication. The
`0.4.0-dev.1` artifact is historical rejected evidence and cannot be composed
with replacement evidence; the `0.4.0-dev.2` artifact is historical passing
fork evidence and cannot satisfy any later candidate.

MAC4-R3 is the implemented bounded orchestration lane historically owned
jointly by the macOS specification and `0.4.0-dev.16` checklist. It may split
the existing one-DMG
notarization into macOS submission, Ubuntu fixed-endpoint wait/log retrieval,
and macOS staple/verification finalization while preserving immutable
version/commit/run/submission/hash binding. It introduces no new application,
credential, entitlement, release, or publication authority. Only the waiter
receives the three notarization API-key secrets; the finalizer receives no
Apple secret. Intermediate unstapled artifacts cannot enter candidate evidence,
and failed-job reruns must reuse the same request instead of resubmitting.
Exact-commit fork run `31163017077` passed this contract and its independently
verified seven-file review artifact while using 13 minutes 51 seconds of macOS
runner time. The draft job skipped and read-only audit found no tag, Release,
draft, or Pages site. This closes MAC4-R3 at its review-only mandatory stop; it
does not satisfy authoritative candidate or MAC5 gates.

Upstream subsequently advanced through `b5800ae`. Ordinary merge `9d3086e`
retains the new independently owned Check Project source-filter contract and
passed the complete affected local matrix, but it changes exact source after
run `31163017077`. Post-merge exact-commit run `31165265090` and its
independently verified seven-file artifact passed with 12 minutes 10 seconds
of macOS-runner use. The draft job skipped and no tag, Release, draft, or Pages
site exists. This closes the refreshed review-only stop without expanding
authority.

The historical `0.4.0-dev.23` checklist carried the registered Agent runtime,
selected Workspace view, Console error-site correction, bounded parse-token
admission, and schema-v11 recovery after the exact `dev.22` workflow rejection.
The historical `0.4.0-dev.24` checklist carried those behaviors forward, added
the Issue #9 Task Rail projection, and now preserves its completed candidate,
installed, publication, and update evidence. The rejected `0.4.0-dev.25`
checklist preserves Issue #5's first candidate attempt. The historical
`0.4.0-dev.26` checklist owns the immutable hosted pass and installed
selection-recovery rejection. The active `0.4.0-dev.27` checklist owns the
bounded recovery replacement identity and now records its exact-source matrix,
cross-platform artifacts, immutable unpublished Draft, installed
seven-workflow ledger, bounded acceptance asset, and MAC5 GO from fresh run
`31391411316`. Run `31337666426` belongs only to rejected `dev.26`; no earlier
run, notarization receipt, hash, or artifact was composed with `dev.27`.

### PROBLEMS-AGENT-REPAIR-5 parser-token cross-review

R5 narrows, rather than removes, R2's prohibition on message-derived source
locations. Only `rho.bridge`, while handling the exact `parse(text=...)` phase,
may decode the bounded anchored `<text>:line:column:` prefix. Localized reason
text, ordinary runtime messages/calls/tracebacks, filenames, and every other
component remain non-authoritative. Exact submitted code independently proves
that the coordinate names an existing Unicode scalar; failures remain
unlocated. This resolves parser ownership without giving the frontend, store,
Agent, or arbitrary Provider text authority to infer source.

Schema v11 belongs to the existing Problems diagnostic stream, not BH3's
broader identity ownership and not a new diagnostic store. It expands only the
closed `error_range_kind` CHECK from `r_expression` to `r_expression` or
`r_parse_token`. The v10-to-v11 rebuild reuses BH3's same-directory backup,
single transaction, assertion, injected rollback, and reopen/recovery
semantics. It copies existing values and never backfills historical parse
messages. Thus R5 does not guess historical ownership, weaken project scoping,
or create a competing migration policy.

Runs/Workspace execution remains the diagnostic source of truth; Problems
remains durable history; Console remains an entry projection; Agent file-edit
remains the sole proposal/Accept mutation lane; CRED-UX4 retains route and
one-credential authority. A parse token is diagnostic context, not execution,
approval, edit permission, or semantic replacement. EOF and unvalidated
locations retain explicit user-selection recovery.

The `dev.22` owner rejection is immutable and cannot be repaired in place.
Application `dev.23`, `rho.bridge 0.1.13`, and store schema 11 were synchronized
R5 identities; Issue #9 later advanced only the application identity to
`dev.24`, leaving the R package versions and schema unchanged. The cross-review
found no unresolved ownership, credential, approval, persistence, project,
release, or sequencing conflict. The immutable `dev.24` candidate later passed
the complete exact-candidate, installed, MAC5, publication, and update gates.
Those facts remain historical and do not satisfy the active `dev.26` contract.

### macOS arm64 platform ownership

The M3 roadmap retains full cross-platform milestone authority. The active
macOS specification owns only the Apple Silicon implementation stream; it may
record a macOS-arm64 sub-gate but cannot close M3 while macOS x64 and Linux x64
remain open.

The accepted About/update design retains endpoint, channel, allowlist, SemVer,
fetch, size, timeout, and user-initiated-install policy. Completed MAC4 adds one
optional schema-v1 macOS artifact, platform-unavailable admission, and
multi-platform page projection under the recorded two-way amendment. It does
not make updater installation or a draft release authoritative.

The active system-credential specification retains stable provider IDs,
redaction, precedence, Agent-only injection, and failure semantics. Its
Windows production backend remains unchanged. Completed MAC3 added Apple
Keychain behind the same abstraction and tests; the macOS specification owns
that adapter and its acceptance while the credential specification retains
shared semantics. It introduced no project credentials, sync, OAuth, key
export, or new credential state.

UX-KEYS-1 retains the common command router, input/dialog ownership, and editor
action semantics; accepted WS2 retains definition lookup/navigation. MAC3 may
add only the macOS Command gesture adapters and deterministic platform fixture,
with existing Ctrl behavior preserved. The fixture is browser/mock test state,
not a second runtime platform authority.

WS1-L2 retains package-source normalization and project-containment ownership.
The MAC2-observed escaped local-source failure contradicts its already active
"provably inside" contract, so MAC3 may repair that implementation deviation
and add regression cases without widening file or navigation authority. The
`/private/var` temporary-directory alias and installed-Bioconductor version
comparisons are test-portability repairs only and do not redefine Lint, Viewer,
fixture, package, or scientific behavior.

BH1/BH2 retain canonical project identity, containment, switching, and recovery
authority. MAC1 may select a platform-appropriate default directory only before
the existing normalization and validation boundary. Jet and the current Ark
session retain process-launch and watchdog authority; the macOS stream may add
only the bounded fallback cleanup named in its active contract.

### Internal extension runtime Phase 1

The implemented Phase 1 architecture owns compiled-in first-party composition
semantics above the Trusted Kernel: validated vocabulary, deterministic graph,
host-owned scope/generation, expected-old publication, reversible effects,
bounded brokers/diagnostics, and the fixed Run History, Workspace Snapshot, and
Project File Viewer migrations. Capability provision does not imply permission:
broker policy, approvals, credentials, processes, filesystem/network access,
persistence, project identity, and audit remain outside the graph.

BH1/BH2 retain authoritative project identity, transition sequencing, and
recovery. ADR-002/ADR-003 retain transport authority. Store remains Run History
authority; the Workspace broker/Ark and Agent lane remain Snapshot authorities;
`read_viewer_file()` and the trusted shell retain viewer containment/rendering.
The public Workbench Protocol proposal cannot infer a new external contract
from this internal crate.

The Rust MSRV contract owns Rust 1.88, Resolver 3, the committed lockfile, and
all six macOS/Windows/Linux stable/MSRV legs. Implemented CI-FAST1 owns only
their timing: Rust Fast is the Draft signal and all six legs are the affected
Ready/`main` integration signal. Exact Ready run `32129767978` passed all six
legs plus unsigned packaged candidate/legacy smoke on each stable platform.
The AGPL transition contract retains source and third-party licensing.

The reviewed dependency set is `petgraph 0.8` with only `std`, workspace
`semver 1.x` with serde, `arc-swap 1.x`, direct `tokio-util 0.7` with only
`rt`, and existing workspace serde/serde_json/thiserror/Tokio. `inventory`,
dynamic loading, Wasm, direct `tracing`, and another runtime remain absent.

PR #76 remains proposed and supplies no discovery/loading authority. Issues
#95/#96 may reuse only typed capability, scope/generation, candidate, effect,
quiesce/dispose, diagnostic, and bounded broker semantics. Execution Targets,
runtime hosts, environments, jobs, attempts, scheduling, transport, schema,
and UI remain separately owned. Candidate is the internal default;
`RHO_INTERNAL_EXTENSION_RUNTIME=legacy` remains process-local for one later
release cycle, and its deletion requires a new active contract.

### aisdk family work

No upstream `aisdk` family change is on the current `0.3.x` path. The proposal
is a deferred catalog. Every external repository change requires a newly
demonstrated gap and separate approval; `aisdk.bioc` remains deferred beyond
`0.3.x`.

## Remaining Open Gates

All installed-app/UI items below are intentionally consolidated under the
candidate checklist and example workflow named above. Completing automated or
browser evidence does not check them off.

- complete the `0.3.x` representative-project reproducibility workflow
  and manual three-viewport UI acceptance;
- retain the passing 2026-07-26 final cross-package validation evidence and
  rerun it after any affected repair (BH1-BH5 and Waves 4-14 may have shifted
  storage, query, migration, or switching behavior);
- retain the accepted WP3 runtime DOM evidence; fresh `1024 x 768` and narrow
  captures remain part of manual acceptance;
- retain the current WP4 package-check result of zero errors, warnings, and
  notes; the local roxygen version mismatch prevented re-documentation;
- complete `0.2.0-dev.12` P0 installed-application acceptance and distribution
  decision;
- complete About/update live endpoint and exact installed-candidate acceptance;
- close per-wave verification and manual acceptance evidence for Waves 4-14;
- define additive artifact acceptance semantics before posture Phase C;
- approve only one Phase-3 capability workstream at a time per the next-phase
  task plan.

## Implementation Start Checklist

Before implementing any unfinished document:

1. follow `active-development-governance.md` and classify the change/risk;
2. identify the owning row in the matrix above;
3. verify its entry condition is satisfied with locateable evidence;
4. confirm no higher-authority active contract forbids or narrows the change;
5. amend conflicts before editing product code;
6. keep browser/mock behavior aligned with Tauri state changes;
7. preserve dedicated mutation and approval lanes;
8. report version/NEWS outcome, automated evidence, manual acceptance,
   worktree state, and release decision as separate facts.
